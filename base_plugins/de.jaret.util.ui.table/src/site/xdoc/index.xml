		The jaret table is a custom drawn table for the SWT gui toolkit. The native tables available in swt do
		lack some functionality and flexibility. 
		</p>
		<p><b>NOTE:</b>
		The SWT team added support for custom drawing, multiline text to the native SWT table. This might solve a lot of
		the most common problems. See the documentation of the SWT table!. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>NOTE:</b>If you are interested in alternative tables for SWT be sure to check <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ktable">KTable</a>.
		KTable is a another custom drawn table for SWT (EPL) that is out there for some time. The jaret table has been developed due two several reasons.
		Those include separation of data model and viewstate
		and support for different row heights. Also look for the <a href="http://eclipse.org/nebula">nebula project</a> which includes the
		nebula grid and the component table that allow for flexible visualizations. 
		</p>
		<p>
		However, do consider using the native table supplied by SWT. This is the strength of SWT and your application will be conforming
		to the platform look and feel. If you use a custom drawn widget it is up to you ...

			The jaret table is in early beta stage!

		<p>
			The jaret table should run on every platform supporting Java 1.5 and SWT. The main testing of the SWT
			component was done on Win32. Some tests have been performed on Linux with the GTK+ version of SWT. Due to the
			nature of the SWT toolkit it can not be guaranteed that the component will work on all platforms. Additional tests
			are planned; feedback is welcome.
