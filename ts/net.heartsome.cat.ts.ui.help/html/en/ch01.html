<p>Heartsome Translation Studio Release 8 provides a range of exciting
    new features. Some of the major new features are listed below:</p>

    
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>All-new integrated interface</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>Centralized implementation of the entire workflow from file
        preparation to post-translation processing, all within the same
        integrated interface.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>All-new project management features</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>Centralised management of project-related files including source
        files, target files, intermediate XLIFF working files, TMX translation
        memory exchange files and word-count analysis reports. This enables
        systematic management of projects files for improved working and
        management efficiency.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Ability to open multiple XLIFF files as a merged
        set</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>Multiple XLIFF files can be easily combined and opened in one
        editing window as if working with a single file. This eliminates the
        need to frequently merge or split the files and so achieves a greater
        level of freedom and flexibility.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>All-new XLIFF editor</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>The form-style XLIFF editor enables a full view of the entire
        file. Two views available: portrait and landscape.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Integrated interface for translation memory (TM) and
        termbase management</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>All your TMs and termbases can be managed in one interface, with
        all your database server connection history saved
        automatically.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>More file formats supported</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>Heartsome Translation Studio Release 8 supports an additional
        range of file formats including MIF files from various versions of
        (Adobe FrameMaker 7/8/9/10), Adobe InDesign IDML files, and SDL Trados
        XLIFF, D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu XLIFF files and Wordfast Pro TXML. Also, its converter
        has been redeveloped for such files as Microsoft Office 2007/2010
        files, HTML, and SDL Trados TagEditor TTX files, enabling more
        accurate extraction of translatable texts into XLIFF and thereby
        improving the quality of localisation projects. With improved file
        format support in Heartsome Translation Studio, users can easily and
        painlessly migrate to Heartsome's working environment.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>All-new efficient XML parser</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>Significantly speeds up opening and processing of files, and
        reduces waiting time leading to greater productivity.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Batch conversion of files</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>When converting source files to or from XLIFF, it is possible to
        choose a single file to convert or multiple files for batch
        conversion.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Innovative machine translation (MT) pre-saving
        feature</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>Supports pre-translation of multiple XLIFF files and can
        directly pre-save MT results in XLIFF files: an industry first.
        Pre-saved machine translations are similar to TM matches in that they
        are used as reference during translation. Users do not have to wait
        for web-returned machine translation (MT) or pay for the extra traffic
        costs associated with repeated access to MT.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>More MT engines supported</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>At present, the two MT engines supported are Google Translate
        API v2 and Bing Translator, with more options to be supported in the
        future.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Visible and text segment based
        segmentation</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>Text segments can be viewed in the XLIFF editor to help decide
        where the file can be further segmented into even smaller pieces. This
        means the localisation project may be more easily assigned based on
        chapters or sections.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Enhanced quick translation functionality, supporting
        replacement of multiple terms</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>Enhanced Example Based Machine Translation (EBMT), supporting
        replacement of multiple terms all at once from one match.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>More flexible QA checks</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>Settings can be adjusted to automatically perform certain QA
        checks on completed or approved translations, or to manually go
        through single or multiple QA checks. This feature caters for users
        whose needs and roles may vary.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>External proofreading support</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>It is now possible to export XLIFF content to DOCX files for
        external proofreading and then import the updates back into the
        XLIFF.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Locking repetitions and translation propagation with
        one-click.</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>Intelligently identifies and automatically locks repeated text
        segments with one-click while keeping the first occurrence unlocked.
        This eliminates the need for manual selection and avoids mistakes that
        can otherwise be caused by manual operation. Upon completion of
        translation, locked segments can be unlocked at any time and the
        propagation function can be used to apply the translation to all
        repetitions.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Detailed Word Count Statistics</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>Statistics can be provided based on text segments or word count,
        including internal and external repetitions, fuzzy matches and
        equivalent word counts. The data is categorized and clearly displayed,
        which facilitates assigning a project based on workload.</p>
      
</li>
<li class="listitem">
        
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>License management</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>Activation and deactivation of licenses can be performed without
        external help. This is highly convenient for users who need to
        frequently use different computers (e.g., home desktop or work laptop)
        with just one license.</p>
