<p>A translation project is often completed by a team of people and
    therefore inevitably involves teamwork. HSTS provides good support for
    collaborating with teams.</p>

<p>Unlike most CAT tools where server-based features are offered as
      separate products and sold at high prices, HSTS
      <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">Professional</span>&rdquo;</span> and <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">Ultimate</span>&rdquo;</span> editions support
      database servers (for a detailed list of supported database types,
      please refer to <a class="xref" href="ch05s03.html#create-tm-wizard" title="New Translation Memory Wizard">the section called &ldquo;New Translation Memory Wizard&rdquo;</a>) and allow team
      members to share TMs and termbases on these servers.</p>

      
<p>By following the <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Maintenance and management of TMs and termbases">instructions
      and recommendations on maintenance and management of databases</a>
      detailed earlier, users can create <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">final databases</span>&rdquo;</span> and
      <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">draft databases</span>&rdquo;</span> (both including TMs and termbases) on any
      computer functioning as a server. Members of the translation team simply
      need to add these TMs/termbases to their project.</p>

      
<p>If your team needs to share TMs or termbases but are located in
      different parts of the world, a cloud database might be a good option.
      HSTS supports both Amazon RDS and ClearDB. For more information, please
      see the product websites of the respective suppliers.</p>

<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Differences between default and non-default
        databases</em></span>
</p>

        
<p>In HSTS, each project can have one <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">default</span>&rdquo;</span>
        TM/termbase, and an unlimited number of <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">non-default
        databases</span>&rdquo;</span> (also called <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">reference databases</span>&rdquo;</span>).
        Default and non-default databases are different in that
        <span class="emphasis"><em>reference databases are read-only</em></span>, meaning you
        can search for matches in these databases but you can't save segments
        in them. On the other hand, <span class="emphasis"><em>default databases are used for
        searching and for saving segments</em></span>.</p>

        
<p>Access to databases can also be controlled with the user
        management system that comes with the database server. Please see the
        management documents of the appropriate database servers for more
        details.</p>
